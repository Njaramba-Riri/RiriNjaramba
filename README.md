## Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which serves as both a portfolio of my work and a blog where I share my thoughts and experiences. I am building this project using Python and Flask.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend of this portfolio is built with Python, a powerful, flexible language that I use for a variety of tasks.
- **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. It's easy to use and perfect for small scale projects like this one.

## Features

The portfolio and blog include the following sections:

1. **Home**: A brief introduction about myself.
2. **About**: More detailed information about me, my skills, and my experiences.
3. **Projects**: Showcases the projects I've worked on, with links to live demos and source code where applicable.
4. **Blog**: A collection of articles and posts written by me, covering a wide range of topics.
5. **Contact**: A form for visitors to get in touch with me.

## Contributions
